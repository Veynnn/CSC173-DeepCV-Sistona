## Abstract
The proliferation of at-home digital otoscopes has increased the risk of ear canal injuries due to improper self-cleaning. Project Limpyo addresses this safety concern by developing an automated classification system designed to assess cerumen (earwax) impaction and infection risks. Utilizing an otoscopic image dataset sourced from Kaggle, this study employs Transfer Learning with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to categorize ear canal conditions.

The proposed system maps visual data into three distinct safety tiers: Low Risk (safe to clean), Medium Risk (use caution), and High Risk (medical intervention required). Initial development focuses on fine-tuning these models to achieve high sensitivity in detecting abnormalities that contraindicate self-cleaning, such as fungal infections or total impaction. By providing a real-time risk assessment, Project Limpyo contributes a critical safety layer to consumer health technology, potentially reducing the incidence of tympanic membrane perforations and external auditory canal trauma. The final framework, implemented in PyTorch, demonstrates the efficacy of deep CV methods in translating complex medical imagery into actionable, user-friendly safety recommendations.
